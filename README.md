#### Topic 2: Test Driven Development (2 days)

##### Reading:
1. [Test Driven Development][tdd]

##### Practice:

1. Use TDD to create the 'Recent file list' behaviour. Some examples of this behaviour is:
  * When the program is run for the first time, the list is empty.
  * When a file is opened, it is added to the recent file list.
  * If an opened file already exists in the recent file list, it is bumped to the top, not duplicated in the list.
  * If the recent file list gets full (typical number of items is 15), the oldest item is removed when a new item is added.
2. Using TDD techniques such as mocking, faking and stubs, try to develop your own blog software featuring:
  * Post new entry
  * Delete existing entry
  * Show 10 most recent entries
